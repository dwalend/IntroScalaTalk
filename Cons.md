#Scala - Cons
##Intimidating, Tall Learning Curve
###Danger - Contains Monads, Category Theory, Programmable Type System
###No Barrier or Marker Between Easy and Hard Concepts
##'Read and Think' Instead of 'Panicked Keyboard Pounding'
###Extremely Poor Theatre for Hourly Consulting
##Does Not Help Figure Out What Problem to Solve
###Using Scala Frees More Time for This Less Pleasant Task
