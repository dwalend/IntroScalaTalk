The Boston Area Scala Enthusiasts MeetUp has had several requests for an introductory level talk on Scala. I recently put such a talk together for my coworkers at HMS that I'd like to share. I'll describe a bit about how Scala's founders intended it to be a scalable programming language, and cite examples that show some success. I will also share some anecdotes from my own career regarding pros and cons of Scala at work and in hobby code. Along the way I'll introduce case classes, Options, a little functional programming, Slick -- a database library, and Spray -- a web service library, all through example code pulled out of source control at my day job.
