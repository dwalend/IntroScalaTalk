# Scala - Cons

## Intimidating, Tall Learning Curve
### Danger - Contains Monads, Category Theory, Rich Type System
### No barrier, or even a marker between the kiddie pool and the diving well
## Read and think instead of "hammer the keyboard"
### Extremely poor theatre for hourly consulting
## Does not help figure out what problem to solve
### Using scala frees more time for this less pleasant task
